# Laravel Fuzzy Search

This Laravel package provides a `FuzzySearchable` trait for Eloquent models, enabling easy implementation of search functionality with support for concatenated attributes. It's designed to enhance search experiences in Laravel applications by allowing more flexible and user-friendly search queries, including partial matches and concatenated field searches.

## Installation

To install the package via Composer, run the following command:

```bash
composer require soliyer/laravel-fuzzy-search
```
Make sure your Laravel version is compatible with this package by checking the Laravel version requirements in the composer.json.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

To add fuzzy search capabilities to your Eloquent models, simply use the `FuzzySearchable` trait and define the attributes you want to make searchable:

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Soliyer\LaravelFuzzySearch\Traits\FuzzySearchable;

class Post extends Model
{
    use FuzzySearchable;

    protected $fillable = ['title', 'body', 'author', 'first_name', 'last_name'];

    // Specify the attributes you want to make searchable
    protected $searchable_attributes = ['title', 'body'];
}
```

You can now perform fuzzy searches on your model like so:

```php
$posts = Post::fuzzySearch('Laravel')->get();
```

This will search the `title` and `body` attributes of the Post model for the term `'Laravel'`, allowing for partial matches and enhancing the search experience.

Searching Concatenated Attributes
If you want to search across concatenated attributes (e.g., first and last name), define your searchable attributes as follows:

```php

protected $searchable_attributes = [
    ['first_name', 'last_name'], // This will concatenate first_name and last_name with a space in between
    'email',
    'company'
];

```

### Key Points:

- **Fillable Array**: This is just an example. Replace or remove the `$fillable` property based on your actual model requirements.
- **Searchable Attributes**: Adapt the `protected $searchable_attributes` array to match the specific attributes you wish to make searchable in your models.

Then, performing a fuzzy search will include these concatenated fields in the search criteria.

## Advanced Usage
The FuzzySearchable trait is flexible; you can further customize search behavior by extending the trait or directly in your model methods.
